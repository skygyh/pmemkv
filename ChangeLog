	* Version 1.2

	This release introduces a new experimantal engine - csmap (cuncurrent
	sorted map, backed by libpmemobj-cpp's concurrent_map).

	We have also provided support for custom comparators for sorted engines.

	Features:
	- csmap engine (concurrent sorted map)
	- support for custom comparator for sorted engines

	Optimizations:
	- vsmap::put() now uses emplace() internally

	Other changes:
	- test framework refactor (scenario-based tests, extednded tests for
		concurrentcy and sorting)

	- fixes compilation of vsmap engine on newer compilers
	- introduces requirement on size of std::string to be less than or equal to 32

	* Version 1.1

	This release introduces a defragmentation feature and cmap engine
	optimizations.

	Features:
	- API extension for defragmentation (currently supported only by cmap engine)

	Optimizations:
	- faster restart time of cmap engine
	- faster put method execution for cmap engine

	* Version 1.0

	This is the first release of pmemkv project which guarantees backward
	compatibility.

	Optimizations:
	- refactored core for libpmemobj-based engines
	- adjusted cmap engine to libpmemobj-cpp 1.8 optimizations

	Changes in tests and build system:
	- added support for generic tests parameterized i.a. by engine type
	- added framework for pmreorder tests

	Other changes:
	- added new, more specific error statuses
	- added C++ API for config structure
	- added doxygen documentation for C++ API
	- moved function to create configuration from JSON string to a new
		optional library
	- generic support for libpmemobj-based engines for handling persistent
		pointers as a config parameter

	* Version 0.8

	This is the first official release of pmemkv project.

	It unifies and extends native C and C++ API and introduces config
	structure - flexible way for configuring engines.

	Pmemkv core was redesigned - C++ API is implemented on the top of C API
	now and exposed as a header-only library.

	We have also provided extended pmemkv engines and API documentation in
	form of man pages.

	Optimizations:
	- string_view class for optimal keys passing
	- heterogeneous lookup in cmap engine

	Features:
	- added error messages
	- extended error handling

	Changes in tests and build system:
	- added Travis CI
	- cmake creation and build system refactoring
	- added tests with pmemcheck/memcheck/helgrind/drd
	- added clang-format
	- added Coverity support
	- added coverage support
	- added CI jobs for checking compatibility with Ruby, Java, Node.js bindings

	Others:
	- removed functions to iterate over keys only
	- removed engine_context function

	We have also modified existing engines and tests to meet changes in both
	pmemkv core and API. Poorly chosen function names were cleaned up.

	The reason this release has version 0.8 is because we are still open for
	suggestions from customers before we stabilize the APIs and commit
	to maintaining backward compatibility. It does not mean that the library
	is unfinished or unstable. However, more engines and extended
	functionality are planned to be delivered in the future.
