This directory contains C and C++ examples for pmemkv, the library
providing key-value datastore optimized for persistent memory.
For more information see libpmemkv(3).

pmemkv_basic_c/pmemkv_basic.c -- contains basic example workflow
		of C application

pmemkv_basic_cpp/pmemkv_basic.cpp -- contains basic example workflow
		of C++ application

pmemkv_comparator_c/pmemkv_comparator.c -- example of pmemkv used with
		custom comparator (C API)

		custom comparator (C++ API)

pmemkv_config_c/
	* pmemkv_basic_config.c -- example usage of the part of the pmemkv config API,
		which should be preferred.

	* pmemkv_config.c -- example usage of the part of the pmemkv config API
		to set and get data based on their data types.
		It requires to be built:
		- 'rapidjson-devel' package to be installed in the OS and
		- 'BUILD_JSON_CONFIG' pmemkv's CMake variable to be set to ON

		It shows how to use it in single-threaded and concurrent approach.
		It requires to be built:
		- pthread available in the OS
