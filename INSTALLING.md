## Building from Sources

**Prerequisites**

* 64-bit Linux (OSX and Windows are not yet supported)
* libpmem and libpmemobj, which are part of [PMDK](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk) - Persistent Memory Development Kit 1.8
* [libpmemobj-cpp](https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp) - C++ bindings 1.10 for PMDK (required by all engines except blackhole and caching)
* [memkind](https://github.com/memkind/memkind) - Volatile memory manager 1.8.0 (required by vsmap & vcmap engines)
* [TBB](https://github.com/01org/tbb) - Thread Building Blocks (required by vcmap engine)
* [RapidJSON](https://github.com/tencent/rapidjson) - JSON parser (required by `libpmemkv_json_config` helper library)
* Used only for development & testing:
	* [valgrind](https://github.com/pmem/valgrind) - tool for profiling and memory leak detection. *pmem* forked version with *pmemcheck*
		tool is recommended, but upstream/original [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) is also compatible (package valgrind-devel is required).
	* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) - markup converter to generate manpages
	* [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) - tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources
	* [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) - graph visualization software required by _doxygen_
	* [perl](https://www.perl.org/) - for whitespace checker script
	* [clang format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) - to format and check coding style, version 9.0 is required

**Building pmemkv and running tests**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv
cd pmemkv
mkdir ./build
cd ./build
cmake ..                # run CMake
make -j$(nproc)         # build everything
make test               # run all tests
```

Instead of the last command (`make test`) you can run

```sh
ctest --output-on-failure
```

to see the output of failed tests.

Building of the `libpmemkv_json_config` helper library is enabled by default.
If you want to disable it (for example to get rid of the RapidJSON dependency)
run:

```sh
cmake .. -DBUILD_JSON_CONFIG=OFF
```

instead of:

```sh
cmake ..
```

**Managing shared library**

To package `pmemkv` as a shared library and install on your system:

```sh
sudo make install		# install shared library to the default location: /usr/local
sudo make uninstall		# remove shared library and headers
```

To install this library into other locations, pass appropriate value to cmake
using CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable like this:

```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
sudo make install		# install to path specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
sudo make uninstall		# remove shared library and headers from path specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
```

**Out-of-source builds**

If the standard build does not suit your needs, create your own
out-of-source build and run tests like this:

```sh
cd ~
mkdir mybuild
cd mybuild
cmake ~/pmemkv       # this directory should contain the source code of pmemkv
make -j$(nproc)
make test            # or 'ctest --output-on-failure'
```

## Installing on Fedora

Install required packages (this list may be outdated, to see comprehensive list of packages
used in our CI see a Fedora image in [utils directory](./utils/docker/images/)):

```sh
su -c 'dnf install autoconf automake cmake daxctl-devel gcc gcc-c++ \
	libtool ndctl-devel numactl-devel rapidjson-devel tbb-devel'
```

Configure for proxy if necessary:

```sh
git config --global http.proxy <YOUR PROXY>
export HTTP_PROXY="<YOUR PROXY>"
export HTTPS_PROXY="<YOUR PROXY>"
```

Install latest PMDK:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmdk
cd pmdk
make -j$(nproc)
su -c 'make install'
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig
```

Install latest PMDK C++ bindings:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp
cd libpmemobj-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
su -c 'make install'
```

Install latest memkind:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/memkind/memkind
cd memkind
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
su -c 'make install'
```

Finally [build and install pmemkv from sources](#building-from-sources).

## Installing on Ubuntu

Install required packages (this list may be outdated. To see comprehensive list of packages
used in our CI see an Ubuntu image in [utils directory](./utils/docker/images/)):

```sh
sudo apt install autoconf automake build-essential cmake libdaxctl-dev \
	libndctl-dev libnuma-dev libtbb-dev libtool rapidjson-dev
```

Configure for proxy if necessary:

```sh
git config --global http.proxy <YOUR PROXY>
export HTTP_PROXY="<YOUR PROXY>"
export HTTPS_PROXY="<YOUR PROXY>"
```

Install latest PMDK:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmdk
cd pmdk
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Install latest PMDK C++ bindings:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp
cd libpmemobj-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Install latest memkind:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/memkind/memkind
cd memkind
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Finally [build and install pmemkv from sources](#building-from-sources).

## Using Experimental Engines

To enable experimental engine(s) use adequate CMake parameter, e.g.:

```sh
cmake .. -DENGINE_CACHING=ON
```

Now build will contain selected experimental engine(s) and their dependencies, that are not available by default.

Additional libraries (not listed above, in prerequisites section) are required only by caching engine. If you want to use it
you need to follow these instructions:

First build and install `pmemkv` as described above. Then, install client libraries for Memcached:

```sh
cd ~
mkdir work
cd work
wget https://launchpad.net/libmemcached/1.0/0.21/+download/libmemcached-0.21.tar.gz
tar -xvf libmemcached-0.21.tar.gz
mv libmemcached-0.21 libmemcached
cd libmemcached
./configure
make
su -c 'make install'
```

Install client libraries for Redis:

```sh
cd ~
mkdir work
cd work
git clone https://github.com/acl-dev/acl.git
mv acl libacl
cd libacl/lib_acl_cpp
make
cd ../lib_acl
make
cd ../lib_protocol
make
```

## Building packages

```sh
...
cmake .. -DCPACK_GENERATOR="$GEN" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make -j$(nproc) package
```

$GEN is a type of package generator and can be RPM or DEB.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX must be set to a destination where packages will be installed.

## Using a Pool Set

First create a pool set descriptor (`~/pmemkv.poolset` in this example):

```
PMEMPOOLSET
1000M /dev/shm/pmemkv1
1000M /dev/shm/pmemkv2
```

Next initialize the pool set:

```sh
pmempool create --layout pmemkv obj ~/pmemkv.poolset
```
