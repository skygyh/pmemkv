## Building from Sources

### Prerequisites

* **Linux 64-bit** (OSX and Windows are not yet supported)
* **libpmem** and **libpmemobj**, which are part of [PMDK](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk) - Persistent Memory Development Kit 1.9.1
* [**libpmemobj-cpp**](https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp) - C++ PMDK bindings 1.12
* [**memkind**](https://github.com/memkind/memkind) - Volatile memory manager 1.8.0 (required by vsmap & vcmap engines)
* [**TBB**](https://github.com/01org/tbb) - Thread Building Blocks (required by vcmap engine)
* [**RapidJSON**](https://github.com/tencent/rapidjson) - JSON parser 1.0.0 (required by `libpmemkv_json_config` helper library)
* Used only for **testing**:
	* [**pmempool**](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/tree/master/src/tools/pmempool) - pmempool utility, part of PMDK
	* [**valgrind**](https://github.com/pmem/valgrind) - tool for profiling and memory leak detection. *pmem* forked version with *pmemcheck*
		tool is recommended, but upstream/original [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) is also compatible (package valgrind-devel is required).
* Used only for **development**:
	* [**pandoc**](https://pandoc.org/) - markup converter to generate manpages
	* [**doxygen**](http://www.doxygen.nl/) - tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources
	* [**graphviz**](https://www.graphviz.org/) - graph visualization software required by _doxygen_
	* [**perl**](https://www.perl.org/) - for whitespace checker script
	* [**clang format**](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) - to format and check coding style, version 9.0 is required

### Building pmemkv and running tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmemkv
cd pmemkv
mkdir ./build
cd ./build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug		# run CMake, prepare Debug version
make -j$(nproc)					# build everything
make test						# run all tests
```

Instead of the last command (`make test`) you can run

```sh
ctest --output-on-failure
```

to see the output of failed tests.

Building of the `libpmemkv_json_config` helper library is enabled by default.
If you want to disable it (for example to get rid of the RapidJSON dependency)
run:

```sh
cmake .. -DBUILD_JSON_CONFIG=OFF
```

instead of:

```sh
cmake ..
```

### Managing shared library

To package `pmemkv` as a shared library and install on your system:

```sh
cmake .. [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release]	# prepare e.g. Release version
sudo make install			# install shared library to the default location: /usr/local
sudo make uninstall			# remove shared library and headers
```

To install this library into other locations, pass appropriate value to cmake
using CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable like this:

```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release]
sudo make install		# install to path specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
sudo make uninstall		# remove shared library and headers from path specified by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
```

### Out-of-source builds

If the standard build does not suit your needs, create your own
out-of-source build and run tests like this:

```sh
cd ~
mkdir mybuild
cd mybuild
cmake ~/pmemkv       # this directory should contain the source code of pmemkv
make -j$(nproc)
make test            # or 'ctest --output-on-failure'
```

## Installing on Fedora

Install required packages (this list may be outdated, to see comprehensive list of packages
used in our CI see a Fedora image in [utils directory](./utils/docker/images/)):

```sh
su -c 'dnf install autoconf automake cmake daxctl-devel gcc gcc-c++ \
	libtool ndctl-devel numactl-devel rapidjson-devel tbb-devel'
```

Configure for proxy if necessary:

```sh
git config --global http.proxy <YOUR PROXY>
export HTTP_PROXY="<YOUR PROXY>"
export HTTPS_PROXY="<YOUR PROXY>"
```

Install latest PMDK:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmdk
cd pmdk
make -j$(nproc)
su -c 'make install'
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig
```

Install latest PMDK C++ bindings:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp
cd libpmemobj-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
su -c 'make install'
```

Install latest memkind:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/memkind/memkind
cd memkind
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
su -c 'make install'
```

Finally [build and install pmemkv from sources](#building-from-sources).

## Installing on Ubuntu

Install required packages (this list may be outdated. To see comprehensive list of packages
used in our CI see an Ubuntu image in [utils directory](./utils/docker/images/)):

```sh
sudo apt install autoconf automake build-essential cmake libdaxctl-dev \
	libndctl-dev libnuma-dev libtbb-dev libtool rapidjson-dev
```

Configure for proxy if necessary:

```sh
git config --global http.proxy <YOUR PROXY>
export HTTP_PROXY="<YOUR PROXY>"
export HTTPS_PROXY="<YOUR PROXY>"
```

Install latest PMDK:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pmem/pmdk
cd pmdk
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Install latest PMDK C++ bindings:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp
cd libpmemobj-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Install latest memkind:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/memkind/memkind
cd memkind
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Finally [build and install pmemkv from sources](#building-from-sources).

## Using Experimental Engines

To enable experimental engine(s) use adequate CMake parameter, e.g.:

```sh
cmake .. -DENGINE_CSMAP=ON
```

Now build will contain selected experimental engine(s) and their dependencies, that are not available by default.

Experimental engines may require additional libraries, see **prerequisites** section of a selected
engine in [ENGINES-experimental.md](doc/ENGINES-experimental.md).

## Building packages

```sh
...
cmake .. -DCPACK_GENERATOR="$GEN" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release]
make -j$(nproc) package
```

$GEN is a type of package generator and can be RPM or DEB.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX must be set to a destination where packages will be installed.

## Using a Pool Set

First create a pool set descriptor (`~/pmemkv.poolset` in this example):

```
PMEMPOOLSET
1000M /dev/shm/pmemkv1
1000M /dev/shm/pmemkv2
```

Next initialize the pool set:

```sh
pmempool create --layout pmemkv obj ~/pmemkv.poolset
```
